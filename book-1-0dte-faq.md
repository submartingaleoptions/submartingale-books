## What does 0DTE mean?
0DTE means “zero days to expiration.” The option expires the same day. Time moves fast. Risk moves faster.

## Why do 0DTE options move so quickly?
Because time value collapses quickly and sensitivity can rise near expiration. Small index moves can create large option moves.

## Is this book about SPX or SPY?
The book focuses on S&P 500 0DTE options and practical execution details for that ecosystem.

## Is this a “get rich quick” book?
No. It is a rules-based framework that emphasizes defined risk, repeatability, and realistic constraints.

## Does the book reveal the full strategy?
Yes—inside the book. This public page does not publish the full rule set.

## Does the book include backtest results?
Yes. The book reports backtested performance and discusses risk, drawdowns, and exposure time.

## What is exposure time?
Exposure time is how long your capital is actually exposed to market risk. It can be measured in minutes, not just days.

## Why does exposure time matter?
Risk only happens while you are exposed. Two strategies with similar returns can have very different risk profiles depending on exposure.

## Who should avoid 0DTE?
Anyone who cannot follow strict risk limits, trades too large, or cannot accept fast adverse moves should avoid 0DTE.

## Do I need to watch the screen all day?
The book focuses on process and exposure management. It is not about staring at charts all day.

## Does the book teach risk management?
Yes. Risk limits and execution discipline are core themes.

## Is this investment advice?
No. It is educational content and a framework for thinking about strategy evaluation and execution.
