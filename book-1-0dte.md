## What this book is
A rules-based, backtested strategy focused on selling out-of-the-money (OTM) 0DTE SPX call spreads for credit.
The goal is fairly consistent income without overnight risk.

## Strategy snapshot
The core structure is a call credit spread: sell an OTM call and buy a higher-strike call as the hedge.
Positions use a take-profit and stop-loss and are exited by 2PM Eastern.

## Risk warning
Not investment advice. Options involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance does not guarantee future results.
